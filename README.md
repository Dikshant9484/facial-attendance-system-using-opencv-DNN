ðŸŽ“ Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is an AI-powered attendance system that uses DeepFace (FaceNet model) and OpenCV to automatically detect and verify student faces through a webcam. When a student is recognized, their attendance is logged in a daily CSV file.

âš¡ Key Features:

Real-time face detection using OpenCV.

Face verification with DeepFace (Facenet model).

Marks attendance only once per student within a cooldown period (default: 60s).

Logs stored in CSV format with timestamp.

Easy to extend with new student images.

ðŸ”’ Note on Dataset

The student dataset (images) is NOT included in this repository due to privacy and security concerns. You must add your own images in the data/students/ folder for the system to work.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Add GUI for easier management.

Support for multiple face recognition backends (VGG-Face, ArcFace, etc.).

Integration with databases instead of CSV.

Cloud-based attendance dashboard.
